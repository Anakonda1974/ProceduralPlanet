# ProceduralPlanet

ProceduralPlanet is an experimental project focused on generating and rendering planets procedurally using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). The goal is to explore techniques for terrain creation, atmosphere effects and other visual features entirely through code.

## Installation

1. Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Development

Start the development server with live reload:
```sh
npm run dev
```
This launches a local server so you can iterate on the planet rendering.

## Build

To create an optimized production build:
```sh
npm run build
```
The output will be placed in a `dist` directory ready for deployment.

## Features

- Basic scene setup and camera controls
- Procedural terrain generation
- Atmosphere and lighting effects
- Configurable parameters for experimentation

## Future Improvements

- Higher fidelity surface details
- Additional planetary bodies (moons, rings)
- Performance optimizations
- Expanded tooling and documentation
